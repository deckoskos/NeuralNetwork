# NeuralNetwork
Neural network in java which recognizes handwritten numbers from mnist
This neural network was written by Fin Eggers. Here is a link to his YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3OtgsGcMLw&list=PLgomWLYGNl1dL1Qsmgumhcg4HOcWZMd3k A total of 11 videos detailing the creation of this neural network. The only BUT - you need to add the graphical input of the handwritten numbers yourself. You can create a project in the Maven and write down the project settings so as not to suffer with the creation of a graphical shell.
